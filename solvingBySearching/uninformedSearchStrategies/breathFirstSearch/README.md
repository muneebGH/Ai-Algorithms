>Input file comprises of header, state descriptions, rule descriptions and transition matrix. First line of the
 file is header; it is a space separated triplet of integers (M N T). M represents number of states, N represents
 number of rules and T represents number of test cases. Header is followed by an empty line. Description of
 all possible states follows header (after empty line). Each line comprises of one state description. State
 descriptions follow an empty line. State descriptions are followed by rule descriptions (after empty line).
 An M x N transition matrix of integers follows rule descriptions (after empty line) which describe transition
 of each state after applying each action. Transition matrix is followed by an empty line which is followed
 by T number of test cases. Each test case is represented in a line. Each line is a pair of strings separated by
 tab, first string is a state representing initial state and second string is also a state representing final state.__
